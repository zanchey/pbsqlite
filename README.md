You just want to be able to SELECT a drug? You can use these scripts to get an SQLite database from the PBS data. Text extracts are supported at present, with API integration planned.

The data model is largely to what comes out of the text extracts. Some examples are included, or you can transform it into something more complex.

SQLite creates automatic indexes for common queries, and the dataset is so small that most queries should complete in tens of milliseconds.

## Usage

1. Download the text extract Zip file for the month (eg `2021-05-01-v3extracts.zip`).
1. Run `./import-text.py 2021-05-01-v3extracts.zip`.
1. Use your new `pbs-20210501.sqlite3` database with the world's most popular database software.

You just want to be able to SELECT a drug? You can use these scripts to get an SQLite database from the PBS data. Text extracts are supported through the import-text script, and the public API through import-API. The CSV downloads from the API are not yet supported.

The data model is largely to what comes out of the text extracts / API. Some examples are included, or you can transform it into something more complex.

SQLite creates automatic indexes for common queries, and the dataset is so small that most queries should complete in tens of milliseconds.

## Releases

You can download pre-built databases from [pbsqlite releases on GitHub](https://github.com/zanchey/pbsqlite/releases/).

## Usage (API)

1. Create a new virtual environment with sqlite-utils installed; pipenv is recommended (run `pipenv sync`).
1. Run `pipenv run python3 import-api.py`. This will download the most recent schedule.
1. Use your new `pbs-2024-12-01.sqlite3` database with the world's most popular database software.

## Usage (text extracts)

The API client uses [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/) as a dependency.

1. Download the text extract Zip file for the month (eg `2021-05-01-v3extracts.zip`).
1. Run `./import-text.py 2021-05-01-v3extracts.zip`.
1. Use your new `pbs-20210501.sqlite3` database with the world's most popular database software.

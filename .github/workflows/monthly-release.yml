# GitHub Actions' scheduler runs in UTC, which is up to 11 hours behind the
# east coast of Australia; the file generally appears well before midnight on
# the day before it takes effect. GitHub Actions does not have support for
# either timezone (https://github.com/community/community/discussions/13454) or
# "L" (for last), so instead run on the last day of every month
# (https://stackoverflow.com/a/6139310/) and just deal with the failures on
# leap years. Hopefully this will be sorted by 2024.
